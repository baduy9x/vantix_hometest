# vantix_hometest
This is the anwser for Vantix's hometest 

# Environments
Python 3, working in both Mac, Linux and Windows

1. Problem 1:
We count the duplicates item when iterate through the array, keep items that appear more than any item in the array, that is the result. Try some other tests in the code ^^

Run Command like:
**/Users/baduy9x/opt/anaconda3/bin/python /Users/baduy9x/Desktop/projects/vantix_hometest/problem_1.py**

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n) (in case we have all numbers in the array are unique)


2. Problem 2:
We save the current minimum price and the highest profit that we can have while iterate thought the item,
If we found something that we can update (min price, highest profit), then update it.

**/Users/baduy9x/opt/anaconda3/bin/python /Users/baduy9x/Desktop/projects/vantix_hometest/problem_1.py**

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
